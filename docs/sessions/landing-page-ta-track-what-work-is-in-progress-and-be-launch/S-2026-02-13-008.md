# ODRC Updates — CC Developer Dashboard
# Date: 2026-02-13
# Session: Captured from conversation (not a formal session)
# Idea: (new — needs creation)
# App: command-center
# Context: Insight during laundry — CC's UI flow is organized around data taxonomy when it should be organized around the developer's active work and next actions

## ODRC Updates

- NEW OPEN: "CC landing experience should be developer-work-centric, not data-taxonomy-centric. Developer opens CC and sees: what am I working on, what stage is each thing in, what's my next action. Not: here are all your concepts organized by type."

- NEW OPEN: "Landing card design — show active Ideas with phase, last session date, unresolved OPEN count, and recommended next action. One-click to continue any Idea into a Chat session with full context."

- NEW OPEN: "Smart session recommendation — CC analyzes ODRC gaps per Idea and suggests which session type to run next. 'You have gaps in voice of customer — recommend a VoC session.' Developer clicks, CC generates the brief, they're in Chat."

- NEW OPEN: "Recent activity feed — surface recent deploys, ODRC imports, session completions. Shows the developer what happened since they were last here without navigating to separate views."

- NEW OPEN: "Relationship between this developer dashboard and the existing Dashboard view — does this replace it, sit above it, or become an alternative landing page?"
