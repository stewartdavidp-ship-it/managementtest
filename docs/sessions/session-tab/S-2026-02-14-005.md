# ODRC Updates — Session Tab

# Session: S-2026-02-14-005 (Session pacing model — dual-axis tracking, concept blocks, escalating nudges, skill updates)
# Idea: session-tab
# IdeaId: -OlO6yEDlG9FFkjXgAxl
# App: command-center
# Context: Two-link chain that designed a session pacing model giving Chat time-awareness and authority to nudge developers toward healthy link transitions, then codified the model into updated cc-session-structure and cc-link-output skills.

## ODRC Updates

- NEW DECISION: "Session pacing uses concept block count as the primary signal, with elapsed time as secondary context for density interpretation. Time alone is unreliable (developer may step away); concept blocks capture what actually fills context and degrades quality: breadth, not depth."
- NEW DECISION: "A concept block is a new concept entering the conversation — new OPEN explored, topic shift, new decision domain. Sustained back-and-forth on a single topic is one block regardless of exchange count. Chat uses judgment to identify block boundaries, consistent with skill authoring principle of trusting Chat's reasoning."
- NEW DECISION: "Three-tier escalation model tied to concept block accumulation — nudge at ~5-6 blocks, directive at ~8-9 blocks, honest degradation warning at ~12+ blocks. Developer can always override. Nudges grounded in real quality reasons, not arbitrary rules."
- NEW DECISION: "Concept block count is a first-class field in link brief metadata and session.json. Each link reports its count; chain total computed from sum. Gives CC data to refine thresholds over time."
- NEW DECISION: "Pacing tracks two levels — link-level (fuel gauge: concept blocks + elapsed time as context, drives transition nudges, resets per link) and chain-level (lap counter: cumulative blocks across links, drives summation timing, feeds link 3 health check)."
- NEW DECISION: "Concept block count and elapsed minutes are both captured per link in the link brief header. Together they give a density metric (blocks per minute) for CC to understand session intensity patterns."
- NEW RULE: "Elapsed time and concept block count are both captured per link in the link brief metadata header alongside existing fields (purpose declared, purpose achieved)."
- NEW RULE: "Concept block thresholds (5-6, 8-9, 12+) are starting values; CC should refine based on actual usage data."

## Session Notes

### What Was Accomplished
This two-link chain designed and codified a session pacing model for Command Center ideation sessions. The core problem was that Claude has no sense of elapsed time, and developers resist breaking links even when context quality is degrading because stopping feels like losing momentum. Link 1 designed the model; Link 2 wrote it into the skills.

The key innovation is concept-block-driven pacing — tracking how many distinct concepts enter the conversation rather than relying on clock time. A concept block is defined as a new concept entering the conversation (new OPEN, topic shift, decision domain), with Chat using judgment to identify boundaries. Three escalation tiers nudge developers toward transitions as concept density accumulates, with the developer always able to override.

The model was written into cc-session-structure (new Time and Context Awareness subsection, timestamp protocol, updated check-ins) and cc-link-output (concept blocks and elapsed minutes added to link brief header).

### Key Design Principles Established
- Concept blocks are the fuel gauge — breadth degrades context, not depth or clock time
- Time provides context for density interpretation but never triggers nudges independently
- Escalating nudges are advisory and grounded in quality reasons, not arbitrary rules
- Visible counters make context load observable before degradation symptoms appear
- Link-level tracking drives transition nudges; chain-level tracking drives summation timing

### Session Status
- Concepts: 0 OPENs (new), 6 DECISIONs, 2 RULEs, 0 CONSTRAINTs
- Phase: converging
- Next session: Triage the 13 open OPENs from sessions 1-4, particularly CC ingestion mechanics (#3-6). Consider inception brief template design.
