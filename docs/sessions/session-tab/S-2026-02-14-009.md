# ODRC Updates — Session Tab
# Date: 2026-02-14
# Session: S-2026-02-14-009 (Spec Unit 3 — skill updates)
# Idea: session-tab
# IdeaId: -OlO6yEDlG9FFkjXgAxl
# App: command-center
# Context: Produced updated skill files for all four session-related skills: cc-odrc-framework, cc-session-structure, cc-link-output, and cc-summation-link. Skills now encode the chain model, session.json schema, JSON ODRC format, concept block pacing, and summation workflow.

## ODRC Updates

- NEW DECISION: "cc-odrc-framework adds a JSON Format section defining the session.json ODRC item schema (type, text, source_link, affinity, is_tangent, original_open) alongside odrc.counts — the conversational markdown prefix format is retained as a during-session convention, not an output format"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-odrc-framework retains the legacy ODRC Updates markdown format in a Transition Period section, explicitly noting it will be dropped once the processor reads session.json directly"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-session-structure adds a Single-Link Sessions section establishing that the chain model is advisory infrastructure — sessions completing in one link produce the package directly without summation"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-session-structure adds a Single-Link Session Close subsection under Session Closing that directs to cc-summation-link for package format with chain.summation=false and chain.link_count=1"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-summation-link is restructured around producing session.json + debrief.md as the CC package instead of the prior markdown CC Package format — session.json schema v1.0.0 is embedded in the skill with full field reference"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-summation-link defines the debrief.md structure with explicit guidance that the first 2-3 paragraphs must stand alone because they become the debrief_summary field in session.json"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-summation-link includes the ODRC Updates markdown document as a transition-period deliverable in the zip alongside session.json, matching the three-phase transition strategy (Phase 1: both formats, Phase 2: JSON direct, Phase 3: drop markdown)"
- NEW DECISION: "cc-link-output adds concept block count and elapsed minutes to the link brief metadata header, with a note that together they yield a density metric for understanding session intensity"
- NEW DECISION: "Concept block threshold values (5-6, 8-9, 12+) in cc-session-structure are explicitly labeled as starting values that CC will refine based on actual usage data"

## Session Notes

### What Was Accomplished
Produced the four updated skill files that encode the session tab's design decisions into the operational skills Claude reads during ideation sessions. The skills were written against the implemented codebase (v8.66.0+) to ensure alignment with the session.json schema already built into SessionPackageProcessor, the ODRC item types validated by the processor, and the session log entry structure in IdeaManager.

The biggest structural change was in cc-summation-link, which previously defined a markdown "CC Package" format. It now produces session.json + debrief.md as the primary deliverables, with the full session.json schema embedded in the skill so any Claude instance can produce a valid package without external references.

### Key Design Principles Established
- Skills reference the implemented session.json schema directly — the skill and the code agree on field names, types, and structure
- Conversational ODRC prefixes (NEW DECISION, etc.) are retained as a during-session readability convention, clearly separated from the JSON output format
- The transition period is explicit in both cc-odrc-framework and cc-summation-link — legacy markdown format is produced alongside JSON until Phase 3
- Single-link sessions are a first-class path, not an edge case — cc-session-structure and cc-summation-link both handle them naturally

### Session Status
- Concepts: 9 DECISIONs (new), 0 OPENs (new), 0 resolved, 0 RULEs, 0 CONSTRAINTs
- Phase: spec-ready (unchanged)
- Next session: Spec Unit 4 — landing page & session card UX. This covers session card states, staleness indicators, active session display, brief generation triggers, and the landing page workflow that ties session lifecycle to the card UI.
