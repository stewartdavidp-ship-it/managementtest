Command Center v8.55.2 — Streams Evolution: Data Model + Concept Parser
=========================================================================
Released: 2026-02-11

Session 1 of the CC Streams Evolution project. Extends the stream data model
and adds automatic concept extraction from pushed documents.

STREAM DATA MODEL (Analytics Satellite v1.0.1)
- Extended model: appIds[], project, concepts[], artifacts[], sessions[],
  tests{}, codeReview{}, openItems[], next
- Multi-app scope: streams can now span multiple apps
- Migration: existing streams auto-enriched with safe defaults on load
- New statuses: planning, testing, archived

STREAM EDITOR ENHANCEMENTS
- Additional Apps multi-select (chip toggles)
- Project field with datalist from existing streams
- Next field (drives session prep)
- Open Items textarea (one per line)
- All new status options in dropdown

STREAM CARD BADGES
- Multi-app count, concept count, open items count, test coverage
- Stats bar: flex-wrap with planning/testing counts

CONCEPT PARSER (CC Core)
- parseConcepts(): regex extraction from <!-- cc-concepts --> markers
- checkPushedDocsForConcepts(): auto-prompt after doc push
- Hooked into all 3 doc push flows (Deploy All x2, Session Wizard)
- Deduplication by text when merging into existing stream concepts
- Console instrumentation: [Concepts] prefix at all decision points

Command Center v8.55.0 — Smart Deploy Validation Complete
==========================================================
Released: 2026-02-11

Completes the four remaining validation rules from the SMART_DEPLOY_REDESIGN design doc.

SMART DEPLOY VALIDATION
- Auto-Bump buttons: Per-app "Auto-Bump to vX.X.X" button on version-not-incremented issues
  - Patches index.html + sw.js versions in-memory without re-uploading
  - "Fix All" banner button when 2+ apps need bumps
- Shared files validation: Warns when shared files (e.g. shared/cc-shared.css) are new to repo
- Repo access check: Verifies push access to all target repos before deploy
- Cross-app version consistency: Warns about divergent major versions within a project

NEW GITHUB API METHODS
- checkPushAccess(repo) — verify push permissions
- fileExists(repo, path) — check if file exists in repo

- Removed empty view stubs: Repo Files, Environment Optimization, Users, Beta Analytics
- Removed empty service stubs: PorkbunService, GoDaddyService, DomainProviderRegistry
- Removed empty ProductBriefModal comment block
- Compressed consecutive blank lines

CROSS-APP NAVIGATION
- All 3 satellites verified using SatelliteHeader with CC logo + back link

FINAL LINE COUNT AUDIT
- Core:            20,307 lines (target: ≤20K — 307 over due to SessionLaunchModal)
- Infrastructure:   7,014 lines (target: ≤7K — at target)
- Quality:          3,729 lines (target: ≤5K ✅)
- Analytics:        4,034 lines (target: ≤5K ✅)
- Shared CSS:         404 lines (target: ≤500 ✅)
- Shared JS:          341 lines (target: ≤500 ✅)
- Total codebase:  35,829 lines (was 31,774 in monolith — +13% for full satellite extraction)

PROJECT COMPLETE
================
Sessions 1–7 (v8.49.0 – v8.54.0) reduced the monolithic CC Core from 31,774 lines
to 20,307 lines (-36%) while extracting 14,777 lines into 3 satellite apps with
shared infrastructure. The Dashboard was restructured to put app cards front and
center with a new Session Launch Modal for one-click session starts.

Command Center v8.53.0 — Dashboard Workflow: Launch & Land (Session 6)
=====================================================================
Released: 2026-02-11

CORE SIZE
- Core: 20,285 → ~20,350 lines (net +65, added SessionLaunchModal, removed right column)
- This is the smallest change session — focused on UX restructure, not code extraction

PHASE A: DASHBOARD CLEANUP
- Removed 3-column grid → single column layout
- App cards are now the hero — visible immediately without scrolling
- Slim drop zone (one line) replaces bulky upload box
- App cards show as responsive grid with version badges, ready items, session buttons
- Pipeline summary bar (collapsed) replaces right-column stats
- Quick actions bar simplified (removed Smart Deploy, Portfolio, Sync buttons)

PHASE B: SESSION LAUNCH MODAL
- 🤖 icon on each app card when ready work items exist
- Opens lightweight SessionLaunchModal (not the full 3-step ClaudePrepModal)
- Fast path: top 3 items pre-checked, auto-suggested session type, one-click generate
- Expandable section: full item picker, type selector, recent session history
- Creates session record, transitions items, downloads prep zip, copies prompt
- Existing ClaudePrepModal via Projects tab unchanged

PHASE C: SMART DEPLOY RETURN
- Post-deploy summary panel appears inline after successful deploys
- Shows session match, SESSION_RETURN.json results, action buttons
- Replaces need to navigate to Session Log for post-deploy review
- "Review this session?" nudge for deploys without SESSION_RETURN.json

PHASE D: NAV CONSOLIDATION
- 5 nav sections → 4: Deploy, Plan, Sessions, Settings
- Smart Deploy removed from nav (view preserved for direct access)
- Projects + Backlog merged under "Plan"
- Maintain → Sessions, Configure → Settings (renamed)
