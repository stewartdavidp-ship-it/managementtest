            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <div class="effective">Effective Date: February 19, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Command Center by Dave Stewart</div>
        </div>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Command Center ("CC", "the Service"), an AI-powered ideation and development management platform operated by Dave Stewart ("we", "us", "our"). By accessing or using CC, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>CC is a development tool that helps manage the ideation-to-build lifecycle for software projects. It provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Structured ideation tracking using the ODRC (Open, Decision, Rule, Constraint) framework</li>
            <li>Session management for AI-assisted development conversations</li>
            <li>Job creation and lifecycle tracking for build tasks</li>
            <li>An MCP server enabling AI assistants to interact with project data</li>
            <li>A web-based dashboard for visualizing project state</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Account and Access</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Eligibility</h3>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use CC. By creating an account, you represent that you meet this requirement.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Account Security</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials, including your Google sign-in and any API keys you configure within CC. You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Access</h3>
        <p>Access to CC is provided by invitation or approval. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access at any time, for any reason, with reasonable notice when possible.</p>

        <h2>3. Your Content</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Ownership</h3>
        <p>You retain full ownership of all content you create in CC, including ideas, concepts, session records, job instructions, and any documents or artifacts you produce. We claim no intellectual property rights over your content.</p>

        <h3>3.2 License to Operate</h3>
        <p>By using CC, you grant us a limited license to store, process, display, and transmit your content solely for the purpose of operating the Service. This license terminates when you delete your content or your account.</p>

        <h3>3.3 AI-Generated Content</h3>
        <p>CC facilitates AI-assisted ideation through Claude (Anthropic's AI). Content generated or suggested by AI assistants during sessions is provided as-is. You are responsible for reviewing, validating, and accepting or rejecting any AI-generated content before relying on it. We make no warranties about the accuracy, completeness, or fitness of AI-generated content for any particular purpose.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party API Keys</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Your Responsibility</h3>
        <p>CC allows you to configure API keys for third-party services (GitHub, Anthropic, domain providers, Firebase). You are solely responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The security and appropriate use of your API keys</li>
            <li>Compliance with each third-party service's terms of service</li>
            <li>Any costs incurred through API usage (e.g., Anthropic API charges, GitHub API rate limits)</li>
            <li>Revoking compromised keys promptly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 Local Storage</h3>
        <p>API keys are stored in your browser's localStorage. CC does not back up, sync, or recover these keys. You are responsible for maintaining your own records of configured credentials.</p>

        <h2>5. Service Availability</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Beta Status</h3>
        <p>CC is in active development. Features may change, be added, or be removed without notice. We do not guarantee uptime, availability, or uninterrupted service.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Dependencies</h3>
        <p>CC depends on third-party infrastructure including Firebase, Google Cloud, GitHub, and Anthropic. Outages or changes to these services may affect CC functionality. We are not responsible for third-party service disruptions.</p>

        <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>Your use of CC is subject to the <a href="../acceptable-use/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <h3>7.1 As-Is Service</h3>
        <p>CC is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Limitation</h3>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, or business opportunities arising from your use of the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

        <h3>7.3 Data Loss</h3>
        <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, we do not guarantee against data loss. You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of critical content. Content delivered to GitHub repositories serves as one form of backup for delivered documents.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>Either party may terminate this agreement at any time. Upon termination:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your access to CC will be revoked</li>
            <li>You may request export of your data prior to termination</li>
            <li>We will delete your data within 30 days of account termination, unless required by law to retain it</li>
            <li>API keys stored in your browser's localStorage remain under your control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We will make reasonable efforts to notify active users of material changes. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United States, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
