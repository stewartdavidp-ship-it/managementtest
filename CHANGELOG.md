# Command Center — Changelog

## [8.56.1] — 2026-02-11 — Deploy All Reliability Fix

### Fixed (CC Core)
- **Sequential blob creation** — replaced `Promise.all` with sequential uploads + 250ms inter-blob delay to prevent GitHub API throttling
- **Retry with exponential backoff** — `request()` retries up to 3x on TypeError (CORS/network), HTTP 400/502/503 with 1s→2s→4s→8s delays
- **Inter-batch delay** — 1.5s pause between repo batches in Deploy All to let GitHub settle

### Changed (Infrastructure v1.0.2, Quality v1.0.2)
- Version bump for deployment consistency

## [8.56.0] — 2026-02-11 — Streams Evolution: Workstream Brief Generator + Stream Detail UI

### Added (CC Core)
- **`WorkstreamBriefGenerator`** — generates ~30-line markdown brief from stream data (identity, concepts, open items, test status, code review, last session, next)
- **`WorkstreamBriefGenerator.hasData()`** — checks if a stream has enough data for a useful brief
- Console instrumentation: `[StreamBrief]` prefixed logs

### Added (Analytics Satellite v1.2.0)
- **WorkstreamBriefModal** — preview panel with rendered markdown and "Copy Brief" clipboard button
- **StreamDetailPanel** — expandable tabbed detail view within stream cards (click stream name to toggle)
- **Concepts tab** — list with color-coded type badges, active/superseded toggle, manual add, import from cc-concepts block, deduplication, remove
- **Tests tab** — coverage summary, scenario list with click-to-cycle status (untested→pass→fail), add/remove scenarios, auto-recalculate coverage
- **Review tab** — code review status badge, record/edit form (status, date, techniques, issues found/fixed)
- **Artifacts tab** — read-only list with type, name, date, repo
- **Sessions tab** — reverse-chronological history with date, summary, concepts added, tests run
- **"📄 Brief" button** on each stream card action row
- **`saveStreamField()`** helper for inline detail panel updates (no modal close)

## [8.55.2] — 2026-02-11 — Streams Evolution: Data Model + Concept Parser

### Added (Analytics Satellite v1.0.1)
- **Extended stream data model** — `appIds[]`, `project`, `concepts[]`, `artifacts[]`, `sessions[]`, `tests{}`, `codeReview{}`, `openItems[]`, `next` fields
- **Multi-app stream scope** — streams can span multiple apps via `appIds[]` (backward compatible with single `appId`)
- **Stream migration** — `WorkStreamService.migrate()` enriches existing streams with safe defaults on load (no Firebase write)
- **New status values** — `planning`, `testing`, `archived` added to existing `active`, `paused`, `blocked`, `complete`
- **StreamEditModal enhancements** — Additional Apps multi-select, Project field with datalist, Next field, Open Items textarea
- **Stream card evolution badges** — multi-app count, concept count, open items count, test coverage badges
- **`getByProject()`** — filter streams by project scope
- **`getActiveConceptCount()`** — count active concepts on a stream

### Added (CC Core v8.55.2)
- **`parseConcepts(docContent, sourceName)`** — regex parser for `<!-- cc-concepts -->` markers in documents
- **`checkPushedDocsForConcepts()`** — after doc push, checks for concepts and prompts user to associate with a stream
- **Concept extraction hooks** — integrated into all 3 doc push flows: Deploy All (both paths) and Session Wizard pushDocsToRepo
- **WorkStreamService stub extended** — added `update()` method, migration for extended fields, multi-app `filterByApp()`
- **Prop threading** — `globalStreams` added to DashboardView, `showPrompt` threaded through ProjectsTab → ClaudePrepModal

### Changed (Analytics Satellite v1.0.1)
- `filterByApp()` now checks both `appId` and `appIds[]`
- `getActive()` includes `testing` status alongside `active`
- Stats bar redesigned: flex-wrap layout with Planning, Active, Testing, Blocked, Complete, Items, Alerts
- ProductBriefGenerator stream filter is multi-app aware
- Stream edit modal closes on save for updates (was missing)
